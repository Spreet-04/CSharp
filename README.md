# Introduction of C#:
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, versatile, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000 as part of 
its .NET initiative. It's widely used for building a variety of applications, ranging from desktop and web applications to games 
and mobile apps.

# Key Features of C#:
1. Object-Oriented: It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code reusable and organized.
2. Type-Safe: C# ensures that your code doesn't perform unsafe operations, reducing errors and improving reliability.
3. Versatile: You can use C# for developing applications on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and even for game development (thanks to Unity).
4. Rich Library Support: C# comes with an extensive set of libraries in the .NET framework, offering pre-built functionalities to 
speed up development.
5. Automatic Memory Management: With a garbage collector, C# handles memory allocation and deallocation efficiently, reducing 
memory-related issues.
6. Strong Integration with Microsoft Technologies: It's the go-to language for working with Azure, Visual Studio, and other Microsoft ecosystems.
