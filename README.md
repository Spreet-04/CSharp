# CSharp
A Code Repository for C# language.

# Topics Included
## Introduction:
1. What is C# and why C#

### What is C#?
C# is a powerful, modern, and object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It's widely used for building applications like desktop software, web services, games (especially in Unity), and mobile apps.

### Why C#?
1. C# stands out due to its versatility and simplicity, making it a preferred choice for developers. It seamlessly integrates 
with Microsoft's .NET framework, offering powerful libraries for rapid development.

2. With its object-oriented nature, C# promotes clean and reusable code. Its strong type safety and garbage collection ensure 
reliability and efficient memory management. 

3. Whether you're building web apps, mobile apps, games in Unity, or even cloud-based solutions, C# provides the tools and 
flexibility to tackle a wide range of projects. 

4. Plus, its beginner-friendly syntax makes it accessible to new programmers.

## Setting up your environment (Visual Studio/VS Code)
You have two popular options for writing and running C# code: Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Here's how to set them up:

## Using Visual Studio (Full-Fledged IDE):
Visual Studio is a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Microsoft, ideal for professional C# development.

Step 1: Download and Install Visual Studio.

Go to [Visual Studio's Official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Download the Community Edition (free for individual developers).

Step 2: Install Required Workloads.

During installation, select the .NET Desktop Development workload for basic C# projects.

Optionally, add workloads like ASP.NET and Web Development or Game Development with Unity if needed.

Step 3: Start a New Project.

Open Visual Studio, select Create a New Project, and choose a Console App (.NET Core) or any other template based on your project type.

## Using Visual Studio Code (Lightweight Text Editor):
VS Code is a lightweight, customizable editor that's great for working on smaller C# projects.

Step 1: Download and Install VS Code.

Go to [VS Code's official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Step 2: Install the C# Extension.

Open VS Code and go to the Extensions Marketplace.

Search for and install the C# Extension (by Microsoft).

Step 3: Install .NET SDK.

Download and install the .NET SDK Software Development Kit from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) to compile and run C# code.

Step 4: Create and Run Your First Project.

Open a terminal in VS Code, "dotnet new console -o MyFirstApp" run  to create a new project.

Navigate to the project folder and run "dotnet run"  to execute your code.


## Basic Syntax:
1. Variables, data types, and constants.

2. Input/output operations.

## Control Flow:
1. If/else statements.

2. Loops (for, while, do-while, foreach).

## Functions / Methods:
1. Creating and using methods.

2. Parameters and return values.

3. Scope and local/global variables.

# Introduction of C#:
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, versatile, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000 as part of 
its .NET initiative. It's widely used for building a variety of applications, ranging from desktop and web applications to games 
and mobile apps.

# Key Features of C#:
1. Object-Oriented: It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code reusable and organized.
2. Type-Safe: C# ensures that your code doesn't perform unsafe operations, reducing errors and improving reliability.
3. Versatile: You can use C# for developing applications on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and even for game development (thanks to Unity).
4. Rich Library Support: C# comes with an extensive set of libraries in the .NET framework, offering pre-built functionalities to 
speed up development.
5. Automatic Memory Management: With a garbage collector, C# handles memory allocation and deallocation efficiently, reducing 
memory-related issues.
6. Strong Integration with Microsoft Technologies: It's the go-to language for working with Azure, Visual Studio, and other Microsoft ecosystems.
